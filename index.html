   <h2>Why I chose this project</h2>
     <p>Okay, so I chose cricket as my passion project because I have</p>
     <p>always wanted to know everything about cricket, for example the</p>
     <p>famous players. Cricket seemed pretty interesting and fun too.</p>
    <h3>Today I recommend that you listen because we are going to play a game at the end.</h3>
    <h2>What is Cricket and the history that started it?</h2>
</article>	

<article>
     <p>Cricket is a pretty well-known and popular sport. But did you</p>
     <p>know the history of when it started? Well, Iâ€™m going to tell you about</p> 
     <p>it. It started back in the dark ages probably after the roman</p>
     <p>empire(a long, long, long, long, long time ago) in northern Europe.</p>

    <h2>How to play</h2>
     <p>To play the game of cricket you will need a bat and a ball.  It is</p>
     <p>played on a field with teams of 11 players each. The object of the</p>
     <p>game is to score the most runs when your team is batting and when</p> 
     <p>your team is not batting you are supposed to get the other batters</p>
     <p>on the other team out. The rules are from the form of cricket called</p>
     <p>test cricket, the traditional form of cricket, however there are more</p>
     <p>formats but the rules differ slightly. There are four different</p>
     <p>positions in a cricket team, the batsman, bowler, fielder, and the</p>
     <p>wicket keeper. I will tell you about them later on in the next few</p> 
     <p>paragraphs</p>
